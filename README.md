# Fizz Buzz Solution
This is a simple program to solve the fizz buzz coding challenge.


_"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."_

We will be writing this solution with unit tests.
